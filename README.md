# odin-recipes
Project for The Odin Project.
In this project, we were tasked to create a mock recipe website for recipes, which were chosen based on my most cooked meal. 
Created an index.html file as the root for navigating through the website.
Learned how to git add and git commit in a meaningful way. Decided to commit when boilerplate and basic info was built out for each page, then when individual pages were completed.
Forgot to wrap two of the recipes in the anchor tags, had to figure out why the links didn't work, then committed that as the final change.
